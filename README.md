# Challenge Overview
Welcome to the Live Style Guide - Build UI Prototype Challenge.

Last month, we launched a challenge to build a SASS framework for this Live Style Guide. The winning submission from that challenge is attached in the forums.

We need help from the TopCoder Community to convert the SASS framework which covers all styles as used in the Live Style Guide (provided in forums) into a UI prototype as per the storyboard provided in forums.

# General Requirements

- The prototype must include all components provided as part of the SASS framework - refer to the PDF provided in forums. 
- The prototype must follow the navigation scheme as defined in storyboard, implementing the corresponding left and right pane.
- When clicking on the respective element in the left sidebar, it must open the corresponding detail view in the right pane.
- All components (except Logos, Colors, Typography, and Colors) are expected to show sample HTML code for the corresponding component and their various states.
  - Please note that the Storyboard shows sample HTML from Bootstrap style guide but you are expected to show the correct HTML for each component based on the provided SASS framework.
- Logos, Colors and Typography - Show the left and right pane components as per storyboard, no click operations supported.

# Allowed Technologies

# Code Requirements

 HTML/HTML5

- Provide comments on the page elements to give clear explanation of the code usage. The goal is to help future developers understand the code.
- Please use clean INDENTATION for all HTML code so future developers can follow the code.
- All HTML code naming should not have any conflicts or errors.
- Element and Attribute names should be in lowercase and use a "-" or camel naming to separate multiple-word classes (i.e. "main-content", or "mainContent)
- Use semantically correct tags- use H tags for headers, etc. Use strong and em tags instead of bold and italic tags.
- No inline CSS styles- all styles must be placed in an external stylesheet.
- Validate your code- reviewers may accept minor validation errors, but please comment your reason for any validation errors. - Use the validators listed in the scorecard.
- 
CSS3

- Provide comments on the CSS code. We need CSS comments to give a clear explanation of the code usage. The goal is to help future developers understand the code.
- Please use clean INDENTATION for all CSS so developers can follow the code.
- All CSS naming should not have any conflicts.
- As possible use CSS3 style when create all styling.
- Use CSS to space out objects, not clear/transparent images (GIFs or PNGs) and use proper structural CSS to lay out your page. Only use table tags for tables of data/information and not for page layout.
